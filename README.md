# RootGenerator
Uses the General Cubic Formula, in the formula it obtains the discriminant as D to know the type of roots it has. 
In the case that the discriminant is greater than 0 it has 2 complex roots and a real one, if the discriminant is less than zero it has 3 real roots and if the discriminant equals zero it has 2 real ones and one repeated.
